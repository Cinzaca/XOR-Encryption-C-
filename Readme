This program works by extracting 80 bits from a file created by the user and then the user will add a key in hexa format (there is a method for transformin hexa in bytes), then
you the user can use the command from the while loop to apply the XOR algorithm for those 80 bits and they will be stored in another file. There is a CRC algorithm too and other more.
